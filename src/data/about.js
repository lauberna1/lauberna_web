  "Hi! my name is Laureano Berna, I’m 23 years old, and I’m from Mendoza, Argentina. I like building things that look good and work even better. The web became my place to experiment, break things, learn, and rebuild until everything fits together perfectly. I enjoy playing with new ideas and pushing each interface a little further beyond the basics.",
